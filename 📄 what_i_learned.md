# What I Learned

- **Floyd’s Cycle Detection**  
  - Learned how to transform the “duplicate in range” problem into a linked-list cycle detection scenario.  
  - Became comfortable with the tortoise & hare pointers to find the cycle entry point.

- **Space vs. Simplicity Trade-off**  
  - While a frequency array is quick to implement, it may not satisfy the strictest constraints.  
  - It’s crucial to read problem constraints closely and choose the most appropriate algorithm.

- **Pointer Techniques**  
  - Practiced initializing and moving two pointers at different speeds.  
  - Gained intuition for why cycle detection works even in an array context.

- **Defensive Coding**  
  - Reinforced the habit of checking array bounds and off-by-one conditions.  
  - Ensured my solution never writes to or modifies the original `nums` array.
